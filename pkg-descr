accessd allows clients to securely request temporary access to a
system. The server manages the access by running a script that, in
most cases, reconfigures the firewall. It then waits for a period of
time, then runs the script again to unconfigure the firewall exception
created earlier. Encryption of the requests is provided by NaCl.
